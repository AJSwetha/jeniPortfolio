Hello! I’m <span class="mark">Jenifer Swetha</span> , a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in 
<span class="mark">web design</span> and <span class="mark">front-end </span>development. 
I completed my <span class="mark">B.E</span> in <span class="mark">Computer Science Engineering </span>from 
PSN College of Engineering and Technology, Tirunelveli.
 I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly websites and continuously improving my skills in 
<span class="mark">HTML</span> , <span class="mark">CSS</span> , 
<span class="mark">JavaScript</span> ,<span class="mark">UI/UX </span> and <span class="mark">WordPress</span>.</p>

<p> I am a <span class="mark">quick learner</span>, a <span class="mark">friendly team player</span>, and I have 
<span class="mark">good communication skills</span>.
While I sometimes tend to <span class="mark">overthink</span>, I actively work on managing it 
and staying <span class="mark">focused</span>. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, 
spending time with my family and friends, 
visiting temples, and <span class="mark">learning new web technologies</span>.
